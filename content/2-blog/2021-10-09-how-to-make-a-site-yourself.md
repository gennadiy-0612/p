2. Select 10-15 potentially suitable companies by reviewing their work and familiarizing yourself with the professional competence of employees. An important point is warranty service and subsequent technical support. All serious web studios provide these services.
3. Request a calculation of the cost of developing your site.

In the case of a small budget for work, it makes sense to hire a [freelancer](https://freelancehunt.com/freelancer/khortichim.html) or several, but the risks, in this case, are higher than when working with an official firm that concludes a legitimate contract.

## Site design

The graphical designer who is creating the appearance of the site must pay attention to the wishes of the customer, the corporate identity of his company, as well as other provided input data. Usually, they start creating the main page, which takes one week or a couple of months, and after making adjustments, they work out other, following the approved concept. Internal pages create faster.

At this stage, they already must pay attention to how the site will be: adaptive, with changing buttons, pictures, and other elements to fit the user's screen, or with a mobile version when a different version develops for smartphones and mobile phones. The layout designer will take care of the adaptation to various displays for all the elements site.

## Site programming

Programming and site layout often would be combined in one stage, but this does not mean that one person will perform these works. Large projects would require several participants, both the developers and the layout designers.

The programming method directly depends on the selected CMS system. At the same stage API  modules, will be installed. For example, payment with a card on the site and set up synchronization with the company's CRM system and marketplaces, if necessary. Development time and layout time usually vary from a couple of weeks up to two or three months. But for large projects, it can be up to 6-8 months. 

## Filling content 

To help with the creation of a website does not end with its development. Often, a web studio is also engaged in its initial filling: they upload products, texts, videos, animations, etc. To prepare the content should begin at the start stage of site development because preparation does must not slow down the launch process. Usually, the customer's employees need to train to work in the CMS, and the testing of the resource begins in a mode close to the working one at the same stage. 

## Final stages of website development 

To test the resource to eliminate possible bugs and errors is carried out at the development stage and the first weeks after the content is uploaded. Debugging the work of the site is possible at any stage of the site's functioning. Further work on administering the resource has two parts: 

1. information service - publication and updating of the content component;
2. maintenance - ensure the safety and technical integrity of the site.

Most web studios are engaged in technical maintenance only. But they can recommend helping with information, maintenance, and the further promotion of Internet projects to a partner company. Without competent contextual advertising, SMM, or SEO promotion, the number of site visitors may be so insignificant that this will not be enough to fulfill the planned goals of the resource, which took place at the start.
